Before writing documentation, we are going to look at reading documentation. There are several
things to know about documentation:

    - standard library and third party package documentation

- [golang.org](https://go.dev/doc/)  
    - standard library documentation

- [go doc](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go)]  
    - command to read documentation at the command line
    - notice the space in go doc
