[Goroutines](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#goroutines)  

They're called goroutines because the existing terms—threads,
coroutines, processes, and so on—convey inaccurate connotations.
A goroutine has a simple model: it is a function executing
concurrently with other goroutines in the same address space.  
    
Prefix a function or method call with the go keyword to run the call in a new goroutine. When the call completes, the goroutine exits, silently. (The effect is similar to the Unix shell's & notation for running a command in the background.)
