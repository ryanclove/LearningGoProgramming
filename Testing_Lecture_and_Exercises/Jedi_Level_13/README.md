The videos and pdf of Section 29 call them  Ninja levels, I'm going with Jedi in my directories

## Hands-On
[1 - Get the code ready to BET on the code (add benchmarks, examples, tests)](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/tree/master/Testing_Lecture_and_Exercises/Jedi_Level_13/Hands-On-1)  
[2 - Get the code ready to BET however do not write an example for the func that returns a map; and only write a test for it as an extra challenge. Add documentation to the code](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/tree/master/Testing_Lecture_and_Exercises/Jedi_Level_13/Hands-On-2)  
[3 - Get the code ready to BET on, write a table test, add documentation](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/tree/master/Testing_Lecture_and_Exercises/Jedi_Level_13/Hands-On-3)
