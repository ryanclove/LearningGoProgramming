# Note

Instructions for this part said to 

'Create a new, empty directory somewhere outside $GOPATH/src, cd into that directory, 
and then create a new source file, hello.go:'

Because we were only testing if the modules and dependency's were added,
these exist inside the GOPATH/src directory. All sections passed the test.
Did not check if outputted "Hello, World" upon execution.
