The videos and pdf of Section 21 call them  Ninja levels, I'm going with Jedi in my directories

## Hands-On
[1 - launch 2 additional goroutines, use waitgroups](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%209/Hands-On%201/main.go)  
[2 - method sets; pass a value of type *person but not person](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%209/Hands-On%202/main.go)  
[3 - create an incrementer program with goroutines](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%209/Hands-On%203/main.go)  
[4 - fix race condition from HO3 by using mutex](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%209/Hands-On%204/main.go)  
[5 - Fix race codition from HO4 by using atomic](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%209/Hands-On%205/main.go)  
[6 - Create a program that prints out your OS and ARCH](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%209/Hands-On%205/main.go)
