Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/learn/lecture/11922252#overview

The videos of Section 15 call them Jedi Level BUT he changes it to Ninja, the pdf in resources calls them Ninja levels, I'm going with Jedi in my directories

## Hands-On
[1 - Create func foo and bar that return int, string and int](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%201/main.go)  
[2 - Variadic parameters](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%202/main.go)  
[3 - Use defer keyword](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%203/main.go)  
[4 - Create a user defined struct and call a method](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%204/main.go)  
[5 - Create shape types and print their areas](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%205/main.go)  
[6 - Build and use an anonymous func](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%206/main.go)  
[7 - Assign a func to a variable and call that func](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%207/main.go)   
[8 - Create a func that returns a func](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%208/main.go)  
[9 - Use callback to pass a func into a func as an arg](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%209/main.go)  
[10 - Create a func that "encloses" the scope of a variable](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%206/Hands-On%2010/main.go)
