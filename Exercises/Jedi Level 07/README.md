## Hands-On
[1 - Create a val and assign it to a variable, print the address](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2007/Hands-On%201/main.go)  
[2 - Create a struct person, change the value stored at the *person address](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2007/Hands-On%202/main.go)
