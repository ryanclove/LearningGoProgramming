## Hands-On
[1](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%202/Hands-On%201/main.go) - print a number as decimal, binary, and hex  
[2](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%202/Hands-On%202/main.go) - write expressions and assign their values to variables using operators  
[3](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%202/Hands-On%203/main.go) - print values of typed and untyped constants  
[4](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%202/Hands-On%204/main.go) - shift the bits of an int 1 position to the left and print the decimal, binary, and hex values  
[5](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%202/Hands-On%205/main.go) - create a string variable and print the raw string literal  
[6](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%202/Hands-On%206/main.go) - use iota to print the next 4 years as constants
