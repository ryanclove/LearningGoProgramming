## Hands-On
1 - print a number as decimal, binary, and hex  
2 - write expressions and assign their values to variables using operators  
3 - print values of typed and untyped constants  
4 - shift the bits of an int 1 position to the left and print the decimal, binary, and hex values  
5 - create a string variable and print the raw string literal  
6 - use iota to print the next 4 years as constants
