The videos and pdf of Section 23 call them  Ninja levels, I'm going with Jedi in my directories

## Hands-On
[1 - use func literal and buffered channel](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%201/main.go)  
[2 - ](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%202/main.go)  
[3 -  pull the values off the channel using a for range loop](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%203/main.go)  
[4 - pull the values off the channel using a select statement](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%204/main.go)  
[5 - Show the comma ok idiom](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%205/main.go)  
[6 - put numbers to a channel, pull and print the numbers](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%206/main.go)  
[7 - launch 10 goroutines, pull and print the numbers in them](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2010/Hands-On%207/main.go)
