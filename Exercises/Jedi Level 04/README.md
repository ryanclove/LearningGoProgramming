The videos of Section 11 call them Jedi Level BUT he changes it to Ninja, the pdf in resources calls them Ninja levels, I'm going with Jedi in my directories

## Hands-On
[1 - Composite literal ARRAY](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%201/main.go)  
[2 - Composite literal SLICE](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%202/main.go)  
[3 - Use slicing to create new slices](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%203/main.go)  
[4 - Append to slice](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%204/main.go)  
[5 - Delete from a slice](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%205/main.go)  
[6 - Make and Append a slice](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%206/main.go)  
[7 - Create a multi-dimensional slice [][]string](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%207/main.go)   
[8 - Create a map of type string](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%208/main.go)  
[9 - Add a record to map](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%209/main.go)  
[10 - Delete a record from the map](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2004/Hands-On%2010/main.go)
