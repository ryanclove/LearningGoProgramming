## Hands-On
[1](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%201/main.go) - Print every number from 1 to 10,000  
[2](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%202/main.go) - Print every rune code point of the uppercase alphabet 3 times  
[3](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%203/main.go) - Create a for loop using for condition {} syntax  
[4](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%204/main.go) - Create a for loop using for {} syntax aka while  
[5](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%205/main.go) - Print out remainder (modulus) between 10 and 100 when divded by 4  
[6](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%206/main.go) - Create a program that shows the "if statement" in action  
[7](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%207/main.go) - Building on Hands-On 6, use "else if" and "else"  
[8](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%208/main.go) - Create a program that uses a switch statement with no switch expression specified  
[9](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%209/main.go) - Create a program that uses a switch statement with the switch expression specified as a variable of TYPE string with the IDENTIFIER "favSport"  
[10](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%203/Hands-On%2010/main.go) - Write down what the true/false and logic operators print (basically lecture 8.68)
