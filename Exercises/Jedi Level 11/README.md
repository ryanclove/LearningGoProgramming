The videos and pdf of Section 25 call them  Ninja levels, I'm going with Jedi in my directories

## Hands-On
[1 - Instead of blank identifier, check for error](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2011/Hands-On%201/main.go)  
[2 - Create a custom error message using “fmt.Errorf”](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2011/Hands-On%202/main.go)  
[3 - Create a struct “customErr” which implements the builtin.error interface](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2011/Hands-On%203/main.go)  
[4 - use the sqrt.Error struct as a value of type error](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2011/Hands-On%204/main.go)  
[5 - See if you can get a basic example of testing working.](https://github.com/ryanclove/LearningGoProgramming/blob/master/Exercises/Jedi%20Level%2011/Hands-On%205)
